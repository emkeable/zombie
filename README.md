# zombie
This includes Part 2 and Part 3 of the Zombie Simulation Project
. The Alpha Zombie is Magenta, other zombies are Pink. 
Humans turn Yellow when resting and Cyan when running away from a zombie. 
Zombies turn Red when following a human. 
For part 3, I added orange "bombs", created randomly through the ZombieModel update method. 
These "bombs" last for a random number of turns (greater than 5, less than 20), and kill any zombie who runs into it
